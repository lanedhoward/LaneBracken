From canvas page for bracken cave
Environment: Bracken Cave near San Antonio, Texas. 

Biotic components:

Producers
	every few days, get "harvested" and make sellable product
Cotton
Corn

Consumers
Worm-Moth (Corn earworm/Cotton Bollworm, Helicoverpa zea)
	cotton/corn worms harm cotton and corn. 
	lay hundreds of eggs
Bat (Brazilian free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis)
	eat insects (worms? and beetles) , up to 4,000 in a night
Hawk (Red-tailed hawks, Buteo jamaicensis)
	hunt bats

Decomposers
Dermestid Beetle (Dermestes carnivora)
	skin beetles: eat dead animal carcasses
Guano Beetle (Jacobsoniidae)
	eat guano ?? 

Systems:
ecosystem (producers/consumers/decomposers)
and another system of your choice

Player: uses elements to keep the ecosystem in balance

resources:
	money
	cotton product - sellable
	corn product - sellable
	guano - sellable
	carcasses


Vendor: the player should be able to exchange items gathered in (or produced by) the environment for elements that can help keep the systems in balance.
Example: guano, cotton, or corn could be harvested and traded for seeds to plant more crops, hawk deterrents (owl decoy or scarecrow), or other elements.
	scarecrow: reduce hawks for x nights
	seeds: add more corn/cotton
	insecticide: kill worms
	guano miners: hire to harvest guano for a few days?

You could have prices fluctuate depending on other factors (such as weather).
	rainy days make crops grow twice as fast? but make hawks and bats less effective (hard to fly in rain)

Whatever you choose should have both positive and negative consequences. For example, if you sell all your crops the worm population could drop because they have lost their food source, which then could impact the bat population as they will no longer have enough worms to eat.
Event handlers: notify when a critical element is out of balance.
Example: Not enough cotton or corn to sustain the worm population to feed the bats.
